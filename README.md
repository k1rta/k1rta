# Hello, :globe_with_meridians: !

:octocat: My name is Kirta and I am from Tallinn, Estonia. I currently work as a Test Automation Developer.

# :dart: Bio

<p>
I obtained a BScSS and MSSc in International Relations from Tallinn University of Technology.

I have previously studied in Cyprus and South Korea and worked in Malta.

I have 7 years of working experience as a software tester at Kuehne+Nagel, Kindred and for the last 3 years I have worked in my own company called Nekmit.

I like doggos, sports, photography, nature and travelling.

I am systematic in my assignments, try to take life as positive as possible, easy to approach and not affraid to be independent in complicated situations, but always ready to ask for help if it is needed.

I also offer software testing consultants under [Mitker](https://mitker.ee/) and giving software testing trainings with my two amigos @erkkokebbinau and @helenanull under [BigByte](https://bigbyte.ee/).

I am super happy if my day-to-day work consists of the following frameworks, tools and machine:

I enjoy creating automated tests and making complicated test automation code into easily understandable, structured and neat test automation code. I think critically and adobt changes easily if they help to improve current working climate.

Keywords: software testing, test automation, continuous integration.
